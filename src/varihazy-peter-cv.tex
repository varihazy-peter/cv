\cvsect{Who Am I?}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.48\textwidth} % 40% of the page width for the introduction text
	\vspace{-\baselineskip} % Required for vertically aligning minipages
	From my childhood I liked creating things: play with lego, drow maps, build sand castles.
	So choosing the programming carrier was an pretty obvious choice.
	Because of my work I toutched many field from VAT reporting to industrial farming. 
	Some project was good, same was not. 
	Because of this I identified a couple of characteristics or path that is good for me, my work, and my firm. \\

	\textbf{Simplicity} -- We developers are working (mostly) in teams, so one of the most importand factor of a code is the readibility. \\

\end{minipage}
\hfill % Whitespace between
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\textwidth} % 50% of the page for the skills bar chart
	\vspace{-\baselineskip} % Required for vertically aligning minipages
	\textbf{Twelve-Factor App} -- Simple constraints, that can make the development, deployment and testing easier. \\
	\textbf{Test Driven Development (TDD)} -- I like sleep well and not worrying about the last deployment or some fresh changes. Ergo I write test, and use them to speed up my development. \\
	\textbf{Kubernetes} -- It can take care of many thing so I can focus on my work. \\
	\textbf{Continuous integration} -- There are thing that cannot plan, maybe to complex, maybe too many unknown factor. Keeping the development circle short can make the development more reliable. Working on small steps with a well divided tasks.\\
	\textbf{Do not reinvent the wheel} -- If I need an ORM I use one, 
		if I need a csv parser I pick one, 
		if I need a threadsafe immutable collection I import a library.
		My job is to create a busines value not to implement lib.\\
\end{minipage}

\cvsect{My motto}
{You cannot understand everything. \\
You cannot achieve perfection in anything. \\
Attempt it, and you can see the world and yourself in different ways.}

	\cvsect{Tools}

	\textbf{Linux} --
	I am useing the Arch linux as my only OS more than 10 years.

	\textbf{Docker} -- 
	Because I configured multiple VM during my life,
	I prefer the more isolated approch. Since 2020 I used the docker for miltiple project. \\
	Insted of installing a services (like db) I like to use the docker images, so I can chose the version or have multiple one in the same time.

	\textbf{Git}

	\textbf{Jira, confluence, BitBucket} --
	I started to use the Attlassian products since 2019.

	\textbf{Maven} -- From running the test to formating the source code.

	\textbf{Eclipse} --
	I used Pycharm, netBeans, VS code, but my default choice (if it is possible) is the Eclipse.

	\textbf{Google Cloud Platform (GCP)} --
	I use the GCP since 2019.
